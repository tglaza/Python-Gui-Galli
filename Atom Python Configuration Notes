notes on configuring Atom for Python

Installed the following packages:
Script
Hydrogen
autocomplete-python (might have to configure this for python3)

I had to configure Atom to automatically use Python3 to run code
with Script (CMD-i)
1. open Atom-preferences and 'open config folder'
2. packages - script - library - grammars - python.coffee and change
   file-based and selection-based command from 'python' to 'python3'
3. if I don't do this, it defaults to python2.7 and it won't recognize
   the tkinter package
